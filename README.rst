AlgoPy, a library for Automatic Differentation (AD) in Python
-------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
    AlgoPy allows you to differentiate functions implemented as computer programs
    by using Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) techniques in the forward and
    reverse mode.

    The forward mode propagates univariate Taylor polynomials of arbitrary order.
    Hence it is also possible to use AlgoPy to evaluate higher-order derivative tensors.

    Speciality of AlgoPy is the possibility to differentiate functions that contain
    matrix functions as +,-,*,/, dot, solve, qr, eigh, cholesky.


Rationale:
    Many programs for scientific computing make use of numerical linear algebra.
    The defacto standard for array manipulations in Python is NumPy.
    AlgoPy allows you to write code that can either be evaluated by NumPy, or with
    AlgoPy with little or no modifications to your code.

    Note that this does not mean that any code you wrote can be differentiated with AlgoPy,
    but rather that you can write code that can be evaluated with or without AlgoPy.


Documentation:
    Available at http://packages.python.org/algopy/

    For more documentation have a look at:
        1) the talks in the ./documentation folder
        2) the examples in the ./documentation/examples folder
        3) sphinx documenation ./documentation/sphinx and run `make`


Example:
    Compute directional derivatives of the function f(J)::

        import numpy
        from algopy import UTPM, qr, solve, dot, eigh

        def f(x):
            N,M = x.shape
            Q,R = qr(x)
            Id = numpy.eye(M)
            Rinv = solve(R,Id)
            C = dot(Rinv,Rinv.T)
            l,U = eigh(C)
            return l[0]

        x = UTPM.init_jacobian(numpy.random.random((50,10)))
        y = f(x)
        J = UTPM.extract_jacobian(y)

        print 'Jacobian dy/dx =', J

Installation:

    see http://packages.python.org/algopy/


Features:

    Univariate Taylor Propagation:

        * Univariate Taylor Propagation on Matrices (UTPM)
          Implementation in: `algopy.utpm`
        * Exact Interpolation of Higher Order Derivative Tensors:
          (Hessians, etc.)

    Reverse Mode:

        ALGOPY also features functionality for convenient differentiation of a given
        algorithm. For that, the sequence of operation is recorded by tracing the
        evaluation of the algorithm. Implementation in: `./algopy/tracer.py`

Testing:

    Uses numpy testing facilities. Simply run::

        $ python -c "import algopy; algopy.test()"


Alternatives:

    If you are looking for a robust tool for AD in Python you should try:

        * `PYADOLC`_ a Python wrapper for ADOL-C (C++)
        * `PYCPPAD`_ a Python wrapper for  CppAD (C++)

    However, their support for differentiation of Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA)
    functions is only very limited.
